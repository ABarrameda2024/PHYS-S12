  ### Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture
  <br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">For this assignment, our task was to create a kinetic sculpture using direct current motors. My idea for a kinetic sculpture was to create a mechanism that turned a roll of paper towels, effectively dispensing them whenever the motor was on. Due to time constraints, I was not able to program an Arduino in order to determine how many paper towels were dispensed at one time. This will be my main goal for assignment #4. I first began my assignment by creating a sketch of the mechanism the day before my lab section (M-W 12-3 P.M.).</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After creating my sketch, I chose a wooden cylinder from the lab's spare wooden parts bin. It was about 200 millimeters in height, however it was hard to tell because of my caliper not measuring far enough. In hindsight, a ruler would have been a better tool to measure the height, which ties into the rest of my assignment. One of the key things that I realized after this assignment was that, from now on, I have to be more precise with my measurements instead of "free-handing" things. I marked a generic area to drill by estimating what the middle of the cylinder was.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After getting a rough estimate, I clamped down the wooden piece and drilled a hole into it. My thought process was that I should be able to hot glue the shaft of a Direct Current motor to this hole, allowing for the cylinder to spin and thus dispensing paper towel rolls.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After drilling the holl, I took a generic direct current motor that was supplied to us in the lab and soldered two wires onto it, as shown in the image. I applied hot glue to the section where the wire joined the motor in order to further strengthen the connection. I tested this motor out briefly, but it turns out that the motor did not have enough torque to properly turn the paper towel roll the way that I wanted. As a result, I asked for and received permission to use a plastic tube that was not only wider (to fit inside the paper towel roll), but also stronger and lighter than the wooden cylinder.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After acquiring a stronger motor and longer tube, I realized that the new tube that I acquired was hollow. In order to make the tube spin, I decided to laser cut a rectangle that I would glue to the tube and use as a base (I would like to give credit to one of my classmates in the lab for this idea, but I do not know her name. Thank you very much for the help!). The length of this rectangle was 73 millimeters, while the width of the rectangle was around 50 millimeters.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">In order to drill a hole into this cardboard rectangle, I needed a larger drill bit. The reason for the larger drill bit was because of the motor shaft, which was much larger in comparison to my first motor. For this hole, I used an 11/32 drill bit.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">For my next step, I soldered two wires onto the improved DC motor and hot glued them, just as I did with my last motor. Afterwards, I tested the shaft fitment within the cardboard and found that the hole drilled into the cardboard was satisfactory.</font></p>

<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">When I was done testing the motor's connection to the cardboard, I hot glued the shaft to the cardboard in order to make them stick. Furthermore, I found a wooden platform for my paper towel dispenser. This piece was found in the lab's spare wooden parts bin, and I admit that I should have measured the platform for documentation purposes. However, if someone would like to recreate this machine, it should be noted that, as long as the platform is decently sized and gives some room for the motor, it should be fine.</font></p>

<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">I decided that, since the motor was protruding downwards, that I would prop up the motor using three wooden blocks. I would hot glue these wooden blocks to my motor and have the motor be supported by these blocks, as I did not have a drill large enough to make a hole in my wooden platform. If I had access to a larger drill bit that allowed me to make a much larger hole, then I most likely would have gone with that instead of the wooden block method.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After cutting the wooden blocks (used from the spare wood section), I sanded them down using the belt sander. In hindsight, I should have also measured these pieces. If I were to redo this project, I would use a lot of precise measurement with my components. For today's assignment, however, I was on a time crunch and decided to do some things free hand. For this step, I would have also liked to have spent much more time creating flat edges for my wooden stand blocks, as they were slightly angled and made things slightly difficult later on.</font></p>

<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">Speaking of assembly, I hot glued the wooden blocks to the motor and then hot glued my blocks to the wooden platform. I let my hot glue dry and ended up with a successfully-upright paper towel machine.</font></p>

As you can see, it unravels the paper towel, however it does not move the paper towel out of the way whilst doing so. (P.S., if the current is reversed, this works as a paper towel roll re-roller!)</font></p>
