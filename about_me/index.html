  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)">My parents are from the island nation of Cuba, so I also speak fluent Spanish! I am very excited to work alongside everyone this summer, and I have a lot to learn! As for my hobbies, I enjoy gaming and meeting new people. I personally believe that everyone could always learn a new perspective or idea, which is one of my motivations for coming to <font color="crimson"> <b>Harvard.</b> </font> If you ever have any questions, or just want to chat, feel free to email me at <b>abarrameda24@student.ignatius.edu</b></p>
