  ### About Me!
<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)">My name is <b>Alexander Cristo Barrameda!</b> I am from Cleveland, Ohio, and I am a rising junior in the class of 2024! 
    I am a fan of the engineering field, and my parents are from the island of Cuba. As a result, I can speak both English and Spanish.
    I chose Harvard Summer School because of the remarkable interactions and connections that can be had with my classmates, and I am very grateful to be here. As for my final project proposal, I would like to create a model wheelchair with a motorized seat lifting kit, so that the immobilized could get into bed or into their vehicles easier. My current proposal was inspired by the medical field, especially when it comes to caring for elders.</p>

  There are still a lot of unknowns about my project, but I am looking forward to designing it!
