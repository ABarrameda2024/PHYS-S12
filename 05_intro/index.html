  ### Week 5: 3D Printing and Design
<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">For the fifth assignment, we were tasked with: 3D printing an object that is a component of our final project (or an object that cannot easily be made subtractively), scanning an object with a photogrammetry application, and updating our website and our final project ideas. My final project updates will be reflected on its own respective page, rather than on this one. Starting with my 3D print, I decided to make a component of my final project: one leg and its respective housing (the section where the motor/power supply will be placed). While this can be made rather easily through subtractive methods, I still found that this piece is essential to the prototyping phase of my final project, as it helps me figure out what design could work for the leg of my lifting wheelchair. First, I started with a simple sketch of two rectangles with an offset of 20mm cubed for the leg and 21mm cubed for the housing:</font></p>

  .center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
}
</style>
  <img src="./png1.png" width="400" height="242" alt="image1" class="center">
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After creating my sketch, I extruded the two shapes and realized that my housing would be too thick for an ideal design. I filleted the leg design in order to make it smoother, but I noticed that the housing would have to be changed. This is shown here:</font></p>
<style>
  .center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
}
</style>
  <img src="./png2.png" width="400" height="242" alt="image2" class="center">
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">The aforementioned change in the sketch is shown below. The offset was kept at 21mm by 21mm, so that the leg could fit through the gap.</font></p>

  <img src="./png3.png" width="400" height="242" alt="image3" class="center">
<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After fixing my sketch, I extruded the two shapes and made the leg taller than the housing. My idea was that the leg would be able to slide in and out of the housing as if it were on rails and being moved back and forth by a motor. I am not at the stage yet to where I have access to rails and motors for such a small prototype, so this helped me flesh out my idea for this project. I also separated the two objects from each other so that they would not be attached when I exported it to PrusaSlicer.</font></p>

<br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">After exporting the .stl file to PrusaSlicer, I configured the settings for my G-code by changing the print settings to 0.30mm draft (to shorten the time needed for printing) and I scaled down the object from 45% to 30% of its original size, thus making the printing time around 15 minutes. (This was the maximum time set by the lab instructor for the majority of our prints). The images shown below are 1) the 45% sized print, and 2) the 30% sized print.</font></p>
