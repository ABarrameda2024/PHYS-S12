  ### Week 9: WiFi, Bluetooth, and Radio
  <br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">For this week's assignment, we were tasked with controlling a board from a local wireless network. In my case, I used a regular ESP32 provided in the lab in order to rotate a DC motor. Using the L9110 motor driver, I connected my DC motor to my ESP32 and chose some pins to connect the information between my ESP and the DC motor. Here is my wiring: </font></p>

  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)"><font size="+2">After I wired everything up (using the provided L9110 guide for wiring), I had to tackle my most difficult task: coding. As I have said before, I am not an experienced coder by any means, and I virtually have no background in coding. Despite this, I am not only satisfied but also happy with my "mish-mash" of code that I created in Wednesday's lab. First, I started with the code provided by the SimpleWifiServer example given by the tutorial. Afterwards, I removed the ending section of code which terminated the connection, as it would not work otherwise. I also swapped out the LED commands with the settings of the motor, telling the motor to turn on whenever it got /H from the GET requests and turn off whenever it received /L from the GET requests. While this is simple code in hindsight, putting the two together took a lot longer than I anticipated. Here is my code, as well as a video of the code in action:</font></p> 
  <pre><code>
    #include <WiFi.h>

const char* ssid     = "MAKERSPACE";
const char* password = "12345678";

const int A1A = 27;  // define pin 3 for A-1A 
const int A1B = 26;  // define pin 4 for A-1B 

WiFiServer server(80);

void setup()
{
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(10);

    // We start by connecting to a WiFi network

    Serial.println();
    Serial.println();
    Serial.print("Connecting to ");
    Serial.println(ssid);

    WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

    while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
        delay(500);
        Serial.print(".");
    }

    Serial.println("");
    Serial.println("WiFi connected.");
    Serial.println("IP address: ");
    Serial.println(WiFi.localIP());
    
    server.begin();

}

int value = 0;

void loop(){
 WiFiClient client = server.available();   // listen for incoming clients

  if (client) {                             // if you get a client,
    Serial.println("New Client.");           // print a message out the serial port
    String currentLine = "";                // make a String to hold incoming data from the client
    while (client.connected()) {            // loop while the client's connected
      if (client.available()) {             // if there's bytes to read from the client,
        char c = client.read();             // read a byte, then
        Serial.write(c);                    // print it out the serial monitor
        if (c == '\n') {                    // if the byte is a newline character

          // if the current line is blank, you got two newline characters in a row.
          // that's the end of the client HTTP request, so send a response:
          if (currentLine.length() == 0) {
            // HTTP headers always start with a response code (e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
            // and a content-type so the client knows what's coming, then a blank line:
            client.println("HTTP/1.1 200 OK");
            client.println("Content-type:text/html");
            client.println();

            // the content of the HTTP response follows the header:
            client.print("Click <a href=\"/H\">here</a> to turn the motor on.<br>");
            client.print("Click <a href=\"/L\">here</a> to turn the motor off.<br>");

            // The HTTP response ends with another blank line:
            client.println();
            // break out of the while loop:
            break;
          } else {    // if you got a newline, then clear currentLine:
            currentLine = "";
          }
        } else if (c != '\r') {  // if you got anything else but a carriage return character,
          currentLine += c;      // add it to the end of the currentLine
        }

        // Check to see if the client request was "GET /H" or "GET /L":
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /H")) {
          digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
          digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);               // GET /H turns the LED on
        }
        if (currentLine.endsWith("GET /L")) {
  digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // setting both pins LOW stops the motor 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);   // redundant, but doesn't hurt 
}
        }
      }
    }
  }
