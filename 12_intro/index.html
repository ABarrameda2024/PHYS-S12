  ## Final Project Proposals!
<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">Due to my parent's line of work, I have seen some struggles that elders may go through when being assisted into their bed from their wheelchair. The risks involved in standing from one's wheelchair may be too dangerous for some in fragile condition. As a result, one of my proposals is a wheelchair with a lifting seat.</font></p>

<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)"><font size="+2">However, wheelchairs that have lifting capabilities normally cost thousands of dollars, making them unviable for some in hospitals. To counter this, I propose that the mechanism that lifts the seat may be sold separately from the wheelchair and can be fitted to one in order to be more cost effective. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, I would most likely use a smaller model wheelchair.</font></p> 
  <br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)"><font size="+2">My second final project proposal came to me when I was moving into my dorm. As I looked around at my desk, I realized that it was incredibly messy. This gave me the idea for a second potential project, a machine that uses computer vision and perhaps a robotic arm in order to organize objects on a desk. One of my limitations when it comes to this project, however, is that it is ambitious given the fact that I am inexperienced in the digital fabrication field. Programming such a machine to identify certain and specific objects would prove to be a challenging task, leading me to lean towards my first proposal.</font></p>
