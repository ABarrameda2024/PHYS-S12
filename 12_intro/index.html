  ## Final Project Proposals!
<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">Due to my parent's line of work, I have seen some struggles that elders may go through when being assisted into their bed from their wheelchair. The risks involved in standing from one's wheelchair may be too dangerous for some in fragile condition. As a result, one of my proposals is a wheelchair with a lifting seat.</font></p>

<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)"><font size="+2">However, wheelchairs that have lifting capabilities normally cost thousands of dollars, making them unviable for some in hospitals. To counter this, I propose that the mechanism that lifts the seat may be sold separately from the wheelchair and can be fitted to one in order to be more cost effective. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, I would most likely use a smaller model wheelchair.</font></p>
