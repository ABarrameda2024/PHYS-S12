  ## Final Project Proposals!
<br>
  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">Due to my parent's line of work, I have seen some struggles that elders may go through when being assisted into their bed from their wheelchair. The risks involved in standing from one's wheelchair may be too dangerous for some in fragile condition. As a result, my proposal is a wheelchair with a lifting seat.</font></p>

  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48, 255)"><font size="+2">However, wheelchairs that have lifting capabilities normally cost thousands of dollars, making them unviable for some in hospitals. To counter this, I propose that the mechanism that lifts the seat may be sold separately from the wheelchair and can be fitted to one in order to be more cost effective. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, I would most likely use a smaller model wheelchair.</font></p> 
  <br>
<p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">**UPDATES AS OF JULY 6, 2022**: I have created a sketch of the main mechanism for my final project: the leg and motor housing for my wheelchair. There will be four of these individual leg units which will attach to the four corresponding wheels of a wheelchair. My plan, as of now, is to have an input switch or possibly a website which raises and lowers the wheelchair. I will be making a model of my motor and leg designs in order to show the potential of this idea, as making a life-sized version would be too resource intensive and would be too ambitious for the allotted time period. The bill of materials is included in the image, but, to have it in writing, I will need (per ONE leg/housing): One motor [approx. $10-20, one power supply (battery, approx. $5-10), cables for the power supply (supplied in lab), a leg (most likely made of wood, supplied in lab), the housing block (most likely 3D printed, approx. $36 per kg according to Prusa), and rails to guide the wooden leg (may be 3D printed, but I will look into obtaining these rails). </font></p>

  <p style="color:rgb(48, 48,  255)"><font size="+2">My timeline is: Have detailed models of the parts needed by July 10, learn/utilize stepper motors or other inputs for this project by July 15, have a rough model of my project by the 20th, and create a polished and refined version by July 30th. Here is a rudimentary online sketch (using Microsoft Paint) to show how my wheelchair would move up and down by having the legs attach to the centers of the wheels (or hypothetically the bottom of the chair itself)</font></p>
